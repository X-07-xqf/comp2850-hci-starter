Participant A
Date: 2025-11-07 13:30
Context: Computer science student, uses keyboard shortcuts, experiences occasional wrist pain (RSI), prefers dark mode
Consent: ✅ Confirmed verbally
Duration: ~10 minutes

Q1: Last time using task manager?
Response: "I use Todoist for assignments. Yesterday I needed to filter tasks by 'deadline this week', but the filter reset when I switched tabs. Had to re-select it three times during a 15-minute session."

Observations:

Clear frustration with filter functionality

Uses multi-tab workflow (common for developers)

Time wasted due to UI not maintaining state

Shows importance of persistence in user experience

Themes: filter_persistence, multitasking, time_waste, cognitive_load

Q2: Biggest frustration?
Response: "When I mark a task complete and it just disappears. I want to see what I've accomplished today for motivation, but there's no history or confirmation."

Observations:

Psychological need for accomplishment feedback

Lack of progress tracking demotivates

Interface provides no satisfaction/reward for completion

Similar to game design principles (need for feedback loops)

Themes: completion_feedback, progress_tracking, motivation, psychology

Q3: Ever lost important task?
Response: "Not exactly lost, but I once missed following up on an email because it got buried in a long list. There were 30+ tasks and no way to highlight important ones."

Observations:

Problem with long, undifferentiated lists

Need for prioritization features

Real-world consequence (missed communication)

Shows importance of visual hierarchy

Themes: prioritization, list_management, visual_hierarchy, consequences

Q4: Work without mouse?
Response: "My wrist hurts sometimes from too much coding, so I switch to keyboard-only. Most modern apps are okay, but some buttons in task managers aren't accessible - especially custom 'delete' or 'edit' buttons."

Observations:

Accessibility need arises from temporary impairment (RSI)

Inconsistent keyboard support across applications

Health consideration affecting technology use

Shows importance of complete keyboard accessibility

Themes: keyboard_accessibility, motor_impairment, temporary_disability, inconsistent_ux

Q5: Eyes closed or bright sunlight?
Response: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I increase screen brightness. The bigger issue is low contrast text in some apps - light gray on white is impossible to read."

Observations:

Environmental factor affecting accessibility

User has workaround (increase brightness)

Recognizes contrast as a specific problem

Shows situational disability concept

Themes: contrast, environmental_accessibility, situational_disability, readability

Q6: One feature to reduce stress?
Response: "A simple progress bar showing 'X out of Y tasks completed today'. Just seeing progress visually would reduce the anxiety of long lists."

Observations:

Clear request for progress visualization

Anxiety reduction through feedback

Simple, implementable solution suggested

Shows connection between UI and emotional state

Themes: progress_visualization, anxiety_reduction, feedback, simple_solutions

Summary (Participant A)
Top pain points:

Filter persistence - Filter resets when switching tabs, causing time waste and frustration

No completion feedback - Tasks disappear without confirmation, reducing motivation

Keyboard accessibility gaps - Some buttons inaccessible during RSI episodes

Poor contrast - Difficult to read in bright environments

Job story ideas:

"When filtering tasks across multiple tabs, I want filters to persist so I don't waste time re-selecting them."

"When completing tasks, I want to see confirmation and history so I feel motivated by my progress."

"When my wrist hurts, I want full keyboard access so I can continue working without exclusion."

Participant B
Date: 2025-11-07 14:00
Context: Design student, occasional screen reader user (low vision), prefers high contrast themes
Consent: ✅ Confirmed verbally
Duration: ~9 minutes

Q1: Last time using task manager?
Response: "I use Apple Reminders. Last week I added a task but didn't get any confirmation. I added it three times, ending up with duplicates I had to clean up later."

Observations:

No confirmation leads to duplication errors

Trust issue with interface

Extra work created by poor feedback

Shows how missing feedback creates downstream problems

Themes: confirmation_feedback, trust, duplication, downstream_issues

Q2: Biggest frustration?
Response: "Unhelpful error messages. If I type something wrong, just saying 'error' doesn't help. Tell me what's wrong and how to fix it."

Observations:

Strong need for helpful error messages

Current error messages create frustration

Desire for guidance, not just notification

Shows importance of error message design

Themes: error_messages, guidance, frustration, error_design

Q3: Work without mouse?
Response: "As a low vision user, I sometimes use screen reader with keyboard. The worst is when buttons don't have proper labels - the screen reader just says 'button' without telling me what it does."

Observations:

Accessibility issue for screen reader users

Importance of proper ARIA labels

Shows intersection of multiple accessibility needs

Real impact on usability for disabled users

Themes: screen_reader, aria_labels, accessibility, usability

Q4: Bright sunlight experience?
Response: "This is a big problem for me. I was outside and couldn't read my task list at all. The text was gray on white - no contrast. Had to go back inside just to check my tasks."

Observations:

Environmental barrier to access

Mobility impacted (had to change location)

Specific contrast issue identified

Shows real-world impact of design decisions

Themes: contrast, environmental_barrier, mobility, real_world_impact

Q5: One feature to reduce stress?
Response: "Better organization - let me categorize tasks visually with colors or icons. When everything looks the same, it's overwhelming."

Observations:

Need for visual organization

Cognitive overload from homogeneous lists

Visual design as cognitive aid

Shows connection between visual design and stress

Themes: visual_organization, cognitive_overload, visual_design, stress_reduction

Summary (Participant B)
Top pain points:

Missing confirmation causes task duplication and cleanup work

Poor error messages don't guide problem-solving

Screen reader accessibility gaps with unlabeled buttons

Contrast issues prevent outdoor use

Job story ideas:

"When submitting a task, I want clear confirmation so I don't create duplicates."

"When I make an error, I want helpful guidance so I can fix it quickly."

"When using a screen reader, I want properly labeled buttons so I know what each button does."

Participant C
Date: 2025-11-07 14:30
Context: International student, uses data saving mode (JS disabled sometimes), diagnosed with ADHD
Consent: ✅ Confirmed verbally
Duration: ~11 minutes

Q1: Last time using task manager?
Response: "I missed a tutorial because the task was buried in a long list. There were 20+ items and no way to highlight or pin important ones."

Observations:

Real consequence of poor prioritization

Long lists problematic for attention

Need for highlighting/critical marking

Shows impact on academic performance

Themes: prioritization, attention, academic_impact, long_lists

Q2: Biggest frustration?
Response: "Overwhelm. When I have many tasks, I just freeze. A progress bar showing '8/20 completed' would help me feel less anxious and more in control."

Observations:

Emotional response to task management

Progress visualization as anxiety reduction

Need for sense of control

Shows emotional aspect of task management

Themes: overwhelm, anxiety, progress_tracking, emotional_design

Q3: Work without mouse? (Or other accessibility)
Response: "On slow internet abroad, I turn off JavaScript. Many task managers just break. Basic adding/deleting should work without JS."

Observations:

Situational disability (slow internet)

Progressive enhancement needed

Exclusion from basic functionality

Shows global accessibility issue

Themes: progressive_enhancement, no_js, global_accessibility, situational

Q4: One feature to reduce stress?
Response: "Breaking big tasks into smaller steps automatically. If I have 'write essay', help me break it into 'research', 'outline', 'draft', etc."

Observations:

Need for task decomposition

Executive function support

Shows cognitive support need

Suggests AI/automation potential

Themes: task_decomposition, executive_function, cognitive_support, automation

Summary (Participant C)
Top pain points:

No prioritization leads to missed important tasks
