# Peer Pilot Protocol — Week 9

## Study Overview

**Purpose**: Evaluate usability and accessibility of task list prototype with peer participants.

**Type**: Low-risk formative evaluation, peer-to-peer within module.

**Scope**:
- 5–6 participants (lab pairs)
- 4 tasks per session (~15–20 minutes)
- No audio/video recording
- No personally identifiable information collected

**Ethical approval**: Covered by module's blanket low-risk consent for peer learning activities (verified with module leader).

**Data retention**: Anonymised logs stored in private repo for academic year, deleted after module assessment complete.

## Consent Process

### **Before starting** (read aloud to participant):

> "Thank you for agreeing to help test our prototype. This is a quick usability test—it should take about 15-20 minutes. I'll ask you to complete 4 simple tasks while I observe and take notes. I'm testing the interface, not you, so there are no right or wrong answers.
>
> **What we're collecting**:
> - Task completion times (from server logs)
> - Whether you complete each task successfully
> - Any errors or validation issues
> - Your confidence ratings after each task
> - My notes on any hesitations or accessibility issues
>
> **What we're NOT collecting**:
> - Your name, email, or student ID
> - Screen recordings or audio
> - Your device details beyond 'keyboard-only' or 'screen reader'
>
> I'll assign you a random session code (like `P1_7a9f2c`) which will appear in the logs. You can request that I delete all data linked to your session code at any time, even after today.
>
> **You can stop at any time**, no questions asked, and it won't affect your grade.
>
> Do you have any questions before we start?"
